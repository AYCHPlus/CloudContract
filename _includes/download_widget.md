        <p>The recommended way to get started using <code>{{ site.project }}</code> in
        your project is with a dependency management system &ndash; the snippet below can
        be copied and pasted into your build. Need help? See our getting started guides
        on building with <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/">Maven</a> and
        <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/">Gradle</a>. The example below is
        showing how to use the Spring Cloud Contract plugin. In order to use
        Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner you just have to use different libraries
        as presented in the later part of this guide. Of course instead of adding the
        BOM of the concrete dependency you can add the release train BOM and you won't
        have to take care of versioning manually.
