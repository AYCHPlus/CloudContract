If you are getting started with {project-full-name}, or "`Spring`" in general, start by reading
this section. It answers the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions. It
includes an introduction to {project-full-name}, along with installation instructions. We then
walk you through building your first {project-full-name} application, discussing some core
principles as we go.

[[getting-started-introducing-spring-cloud-contract]]
== Introducing Spring Cloud Contract

Spring Cloud Contract moves TDD to the level of software architecture. It allows to perform consumer, consumer-driven and producer-driven contract testing.

[[getting-started-introducing-spring-cloud-contract-history]]
=== History

Before becoming Spring Cloud Contract, this project was called https://github.com/Codearte/accurest[Accurest].
It was created by https://twitter.com/mgrzejszczak[Marcin Grzejszczak] and https://twitter.com/jkubrynski[Jakub Kubrynski]
from (https://github.com/Codearte[Codearte]).

The `0.1.0` release took place on 26 Jan 2015 and it became stable with `1.0.0` release on 29 Feb 2016.

[[getting-started-introducing-spring-cloud-contract-why]]
==== Why would you need it?

Assume that we have a system consisting of multiple microservices:

image::images/Deps.png[Microservices Architecture]

[[getting-started-introducing-spring-cloud-contract-testing-issues]]
==== Testing issues

If we wanted to test the application in top left corner to determine whether it can
communicate with other services, we could do one of two things:

- Deploy all microservices and perform end-to-end tests.
- Mock other microservices in unit/integration tests.

Both have their advantages but also a lot of disadvantages.

*Deploy all microservices and perform end to end tests*

Advantages:

- Simulates production.
- Tests real communication between services.

Disadvantages:

- To test one microservice, we have to deploy 6 microservices, a couple of databases,
etc.
- The environment where the tests run is locked for a single suite of tests (nobody else
would be able to run the tests in the meantime).
- They take a long time to run.
- The feedback comes very late in the process.
- They are extremely hard to debug.

*Mock other microservices in unit/integration tests*

Advantages:

- They provide very fast feedback.
- They have no infrastructure requirements.

Disadvantages:

- The implementor of the service creates stubs that might have nothing to do with
reality.
- You can go to production with passing tests and failing production.

To solve the aforementioned issues, Spring Cloud Contract was created. The main idea is to give you very fast feedback, without the need to set up the
whole world of microservices. If you work on stubs, then the only applications you need
are those that your application directly uses.

image::images/Stubs2.png[Stubbed Services]

Spring Cloud Contract gives you the certainty that the stubs that you use were
created by the service that you're calling. Also, if you can use them, it means that they
were tested against the producer's side. In short, you can trust those stubs.

[[getting-started-introducing-spring-cloud-contract-purposes]]
=== Purposes

The main purposes of Spring Cloud Contract are:

- To ensure that HTTP / Messaging stubs (used when developing the client) do exactly
what the actual server-side implementation does.
- To promote ATDD (acceptance test driven developement) method and Microservices architectural style.
- To provide a way to publish changes in contracts that are immediately visible on both sides.
- To generate boilerplate test code to be used on the server side.

By default Spring Cloud Contract integrates with http://wiremock.org[Wiremock] as the HTTP server stub.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Contract's purpose is NOT to start writing business
features in the contracts. Assume that we have a business use case of fraud check. If a
user can be a fraud for 100 different reasons, we would assume that you would create 2
contracts, one for the positive case and one for the negative case. Contract tests are
used to test contracts between applications and not to simulate full behavior.

[[getting-started-what-is-a-contract]]
=== What is a contract?

As consumers of services, we need to define what exactly we want to achieve. We need to
formulate our expectations. That is why we write contracts. In other words a contract is an agreement on how the API / message communication should look like. Let's look at the following example

Assume that you want to send a request containing the ID of a client company and the
amount it wants to borrow from us. You also want to send it to the /fraudcheck url via
the PUT method.

You can find a somewhat longer tour

[[getting-started-three-second-tour-producer]]
=== On the Producer Side

To start working with Spring Cloud Contract, add files with `REST`/messaging contracts
expressed in either Groovy DSL or YAML to the contracts directory, which is set by the
`contractsDslDir` property. By default, it is `$rootDir/src/test/resources/contracts`.

Then add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier dependency and plugin to your build file, as
shown in the following example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/pom.xml[tags=verifier_test_dependencies,indent=0]
----

The following listing shows how to add the plugin, which should go in the build/plugins
portion of the file:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
	<extensions>true</extensions>
</plugin>
----

Running `./mvnw clean install` automatically generates tests that verify the application
compliance with the added contracts. By default, the tests get generated under
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests.`.

As the implementation of the functionalities described by the contracts is not yet
present, the tests fail.

To make them pass, you must add the correct implementation of either handling HTTP
requests or messages. Also, you must add a correct base test class for auto-generated
tests to the project. This class is extended by all the auto-generated tests, and it
should contain all the setup necessary to run them (for example `RestAssuredMockMvc`
controller setup or messaging test setup).

Once the implementation and the test base class are in place, the tests pass, and both the
application and the stub artifacts are built and installed in the local Maven repository.
The changes can now be merged, and both the application and the stub artifacts may be
published in an online repository.

[[getting-started-three-second-tour-consumer]]
=== On the Consumer Side

`Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner` can be used in the integration tests to get a running
WireMock instance or messaging route that simulates the actual service.

To do so, add the dependency to `Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner`, as shown in the
following example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client/pom.xml[tags=stub_runner,indent=0]
----

You can get the Producer-side stubs installed in your Maven repository in either of two
ways:

* By checking out the Producer side repository and adding contracts and generating the stubs
by running the following commands:
+
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ cd local-http-server-repo
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
----
TIP: The tests are being skipped because the Producer-side contract implementation is not
in place yet, so the automatically-generated contract tests fail.
* By getting already-existing producer service stubs from a remote repository. To do so,
pass the stub artifact IDs and artifact repository URL as `Spring Cloud Contract
Stub Runner` properties, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client/src/test/resources/application-test-repo.yaml[]
----

Now you can annotate your test class with `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`. In the annotation,
provide the `group-id` and `artifact-id` values for `Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner` to
run the collaborators' stubs for you, as shown in the following example:

[source,java, indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.NONE)
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:6565"},
		stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
public class LoanApplicationServiceTests {
----

TIP: Use the `REMOTE` `stubsMode` when downloading stubs from an online repository and
`LOCAL` for offline work.

Now, in your integration test, you can receive stubbed versions of HTTP responses or
messages that are expected to be emitted by the collaborator service.

[[getting-started-first-application]]
== Developing Your First Spring Cloud Contract based application

* <<getting-started-first-application-producer>>
* <<getting-started-first-application-consumer>>

You can find an even more brief tour
<<getting-started-three-second-tour,here>>.

For the sake of this example the `Stub Storage` will be Nexus / Artifactory.

image::getting-started-three-second.png[Getting started first application]

[[getting-started-first-application-producer]]
=== On the Producer Side

To start working with `Spring Cloud Contract`, add Spring Cloud Contract Verifier dependency and plugin to your build file,
as shown in the following example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/pom.xml[tags=verifier_test_dependencies,indent=0]
----

The following listing shows how to add the plugin, which should go in the build/plugins
portion of the file:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
	<extensions>true</extensions>
</plugin>
----

Now let's add files with `REST/` messaging contracts
expressed in either Groovy DSL or YAML to the contracts directory, which is set by the
`contractsDslDir` property. By default, it is `$rootDir/src/test/resources/contracts`.

For the HTTP stubs, a contract defines what kind of response should be returned for a
given request (taking into account the HTTP methods, URLs, headers, status codes, and so
on). The following example shows how an HTTP stub contract:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0,role="primary"]
.groovy
----
package contracts

org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'PUT'
		url '/fraudcheck'
		body([
			   "client.id": $(regex('[0-9]{10}')),
			   loanAmount: 99999
		])
		headers {
			contentType('application/json')
		}
	}
	response {
		status OK()
		body([
			   fraudCheckStatus: "FRAUD",
			   "rejection.reason": "Amount too high"
		])
		headers {
			contentType('application/json')
		}
	}
}
----

[source,yaml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.yaml
----
request:
  method: PUT
  url: /fraudcheck
  body:
    "client.id": 1234567890
    loanAmount: 99999
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
  matchers:
    body:
      - path: $.['client.id']
        type: by_regex
        value: "[0-9]{10}"
response:
  status: 200
  body:
    fraudCheckStatus: "FRAUD"
    "rejection.reason": "Amount too high"
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
----
====

In the case of messaging, you can define:

* The input and the output messages can be defined (taking into account from and where it
was sent, the message body, and the header).
* The methods that should be called after the message is received.
* The methods that, when called, should trigger a message.

The following example shows a Camel messaging contract:

====

.yaml
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/resources/yml/contract_message_scenario3.yml[indent=0]
----
====

Running `./mvnw clean install` automatically generates tests that verify the application
compliance with the added contracts. By default, the generated tests are under
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests.`.

The generated tests will differ, depending on which framework and test type you've setup in your plugin.

In the samples below you'll find:

- the default test mode for HTTP contracts via `MockMvc`
- JAX-RS client via the `JAXRS` test mode
- `WebTestClient` based test (this is particularly recommended while working with Reactive, `Web-Flux`-based applications) set via `WEBTESTCLIENT` test mode
- Spock based test via the `testFramework` property set to `SPOCK`

[[getting-started-cdc]]
== Step-by-step Guide to Consumer Driven Contracts (CDC) with contracts laying on the producer side

Consider an example of Fraud Detection and the Loan Issuance process. The business
scenario is such that we want to issue loans to people but do not want them to steal from
us. The current implementation of our system grants loans to everybody.

Assume that `Loan Issuance` is a client to the `Fraud Detection` server. In the current
sprint, we must develop a new feature: if a client wants to borrow too much money, then
we mark the client as a fraud.

Technical remarks

* Fraud Detection has an `artifact-id` of `http-server`,
* Loan
Issuance has an artifact-id of `http-client`
* both have a `group-id` of `com.example`
* For the sake of this example the `Stub Storage` will be Nexus / Artifactory

Social remarks

* both client and server development teams need to communicate directly and
discuss changes while going through the process
* CDC is all about communication.

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/{branch}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server[server
side code is available here] and https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/{branch}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client[the
client code here].

TIP: In this case, the producer owns the contracts. Physically, all the contract are
in the producer's repository.

[[getting-started-cdc-technical-note]]
=== Technical note

If using the *SNAPSHOT* / *Milestone* / *Release Candidate* versions please add the
following section to your build:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/pom.xml[tags=repos,indent=0]
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/build.gradle[tags=deps_repos,indent=0]
----

For simplicity we will use the following acronyms:

- Loan Issuance - LI - the http client
- Fraud Detection - FD - the http server
- Spring Cloud Contract - SCC

=== Consumer side (Loan Issuance)

As a developer of the Loan Issuance service (a consumer of the Fraud Detection server), you might do the following steps:

. Start doing TDD by writing a test for your feature.
. Write the missing implementation.
. Clone the Fraud Detection service repository locally.
. Define the contract locally in the repo of Fraud Detection service.
. Add the Spring Cloud Contract (SCC) plugin.
. Run the integration tests.
. File a pull request.
. Create an initial implementation.
. Take over the pull request.
. Write the missing implementation.
. Deploy your app.
. Work online.

Let's start with the Loan Issuance flow:

*Start doing TDD by writing a test for your feature.*

----

Assume that you have written a test of your new feature. If a loan application for a big
amount is received, the system should reject that loan application with some description.

*Write the missing implementation.*

At some point in time, you need to send a request to the Fraud Detection service. Assume
that you need to send the request containing the ID of the client and the amount the
client wants to borrow. You want to send it to the `/fraudcheck` url via the `PUT` method.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client/src/main/java/com/example/loan/LoanApplicationService.java[tags=client_call_server,indent=0]
----

For simplicity, the port of the Fraud Detection service is set to `8080`, and the
application runs on `8090`.

If you start the test at this point, it breaks, because no service currently runs on port
`8080`.

*Clone the Fraud Detection service repository locally.*

You can start by playing around with the server side contract. To do so, you must first
clone it.

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ git clone https://your-git-server.com/server-side.git local-http-server-repo
----

*Define the contract locally in the repo of Fraud Detection service.*

As a consumer, you need to define what exactly you want to achieve. You need to formulate
your expectations. To do so, write the following contract:

IMPORTANT: Place the contract under `src/test/resources/contracts/fraud` folder. The `fraud` folder
is important because the producer's test base class name references that folder.

The YML contract is quite straight-forward. However when you take a look at the Contract
written using a statically typed Groovy DSL - you might wonder what the
`value(client(...), server(...))` parts are. By using this notation, Spring Cloud
Contract lets you define parts of a JSON block, a URL, etc., which are dynamic. In case
of an identifier or a timestamp, you need not hardcode a value. You want to allow some
different ranges of values. To enable ranges of values, you can set regular expressions
matching those values for the consumer side. You can provide the body by means of either
a map notation or String with interpolations.
//TODO: Ensure that the links are correct
Consult the <<contract-dsl>> section for more information. We highly recommend using the map notation!

TIP: You must understand the map notation in order to set up contracts. Please read the
https://groovy-lang.org/json.html[Groovy docs regarding JSON].

The previously shown contract is an agreement between two sides that:

- if an HTTP request is sent with all of
** a `PUT` method on the `/fraudcheck` endpoint,
** a JSON body with a `client.id` that matches the regular expression `[0-9]{10}` and
`loanAmount` equal to `99999`,
** and a `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/vnd.fraud.v1+json`,
- then an HTTP response is sent to the consumer that
** has status `200`,
** contains a JSON body with the `fraudCheckStatus` field containing a value `FRAUD` and
the `rejectionReason` field having value `Amount too high`,
** and a `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/vnd.fraud.v1+json`.

Once you are ready to check the API in practice in the integration tests, you need to
install the stubs locally.

*Add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin.*

We can add either a Maven or a Gradle plugin. In this example, you see how to add Maven.
First, add the `Spring Cloud Contract` BOM.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_bom,indent=0]
----

Next, add the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` Maven plugin

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_maven_plugin,indent=0]
----

Since the plugin was added, you get the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` features which,
from the provided contracts:

- generate and run tests
- produce and install stubs

You do not want to generate tests since you, as the consumer, want only to play with the
stubs. You need to skip the test generation and execution. When you execute:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ cd local-http-server-repo
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
----

In the logs, you see something like this:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----

The following line is extremely important:

----

It confirms that the stubs of the `http-server` have been installed in the local
repository.

*Run the integration tests.*

In order to profit from the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner functionality of automatic
stub downloading, you must do the following in your consumer side project (`Loan
Application service`):

Add the `Spring Cloud Contract` BOM:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client/pom.xml[tags=contract_bom,indent=0]
----

Add the dependency to `Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client/pom.xml[tags=stub_runner,indent=0]
----

Annotate your test class with `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`. In the annotation, provide the
`group-id` and `artifact-id` for the Stub Runner to download the stubs of your
collaborators. (Optional step) Because you're playing with the collaborators offline, you
can also provide the offline work switch (`StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL`).

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client/src/test/java/com/example/loan/LoanApplicationServiceTests.java[tags=autoconfigure_stubrunner,indent=0]
----

Now, when you run your tests, you see something like this:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
2016-07-19 14:22:25.403  INFO 41050 --- [           main] o.s.c.c.stubrunner.AetherStubDownloader  : Desired version is + - will try to resolve the latest version

----

This output means that Stub Runner has found your stubs and started a server for your app
with group id `com.example`, artifact id `http-server` with version `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` of
the stubs and with `stubs` classifier on port `8080`.

*File a pull request.*

What you have done until now is an iterative process. You can play around with the
contract, install it locally, and work on the consumer side until the contract works as
you wish.

Once you are satisfied with the results and the test passes, publish a pull request to
the server side. Currently, the consumer side work is done.

=== Producer side (Fraud Detection server)

As a developer of the Fraud Detection server (a server to the Loan Issuance service) we would like to:

- take over the pull request
- write the missing implementation
- deploy the application

Let's look at the Fraud Detection flow:

[plantuml, getting-started-cdc-server, png]
----
"Fraud\nDetection"->"Fraud\nDetection": take over the\n pull request
"Fraud\nDetection"->"Fraud\nDetection": setup\nSpring Cloud\nContract plugin

"Fraud\nDetection"->"Fraud\nDetection": commit and push changes
"Fraud\nDetection"->"CI": commit pushed!\nTriggers the build
"CI"->"Stub Storage": build successful,\nupload artifacts
----

*Take over the pull request.*

As a reminder, you can see the initial implementation here:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/src/main/java/com/example/fraud/FraudDetectionController.java[tags=server_api,indent=0]
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/src/main/java/com/example/fraud/FraudDetectionController.java[tags=initial_impl,indent=0]
}
----

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ git checkout -b contract-change-pr master
$ git pull https://your-git-server.com/server-side-fork.git contract-change-pr
----

You must add the dependencies needed by the autogenerated tests:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/pom.xml[tags=verifier_test_dependencies,indent=0]
----

In the configuration of the Maven plugin, pass the `packageWithBaseClasses` property

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_maven_plugin,indent=0]
----

IMPORTANT: This example uses "convention based" naming by setting the
`packageWithBaseClasses` property. Doing so means that the two last packages combine to
make the name of the base test class. In our case, the contracts were placed under
`src/test/resources/contracts/fraud`. Since you do not have two packages starting from
the `contracts` folder, pick only one, which should be `fraud`. Add the `Base` suffix and
capitalize `fraud`. That gives you the `FraudBase` test class name.

All the generated tests extend that class. Over there, you can set up your Spring Context
or whatever is necessary. In this case, use https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured[Rest Assured MVC] to
start the server side `FraudDetectionController`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/src/test/java/com/example/fraud/FraudBase.java[]
----

Now, if you run the `./mvnw clean install`, you get something like this:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
Results :

Tests in error:
  ContractVerifierTest.validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud:32 » IllegalState Parsed...
----

This error occurs because you have a new contract from which a test was generated and it
failed since you have not implemented the feature. The auto-generated test would look
like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
        MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
                .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
                .body("{\"client.id\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
        ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
                .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*");
    // and:
        DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['fraudCheckStatus']").matches("[A-Z]{5}");
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['rejection.reason']").isEqualTo("Amount too high");
}
----

If you used the Groovy DSL, you can see, all the `producer()` parts of the Contract that were present in the
`value(consumer(...), producer(...))` blocks got injected into the test.
In case of using YAML, the same applied for the `matchers` sections of the `response`.

Note that, on the producer side, you are also doing TDD. The expectations are expressed
in the form of a test. This test sends a request to our own application with the URL,
headers, and body defined in the contract. It also is expecting precisely defined values
in the response. In other words, you have the `red` part of `red`, `green`, and
`refactor`. It is time to convert the `red` into the `green`.

*Write the missing implementation.*

Because you know the expected input and expected output, you can write the missing
implementation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/src/main/java/com/example/fraud/FraudDetectionController.java[tags=server_api,indent=0]
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/src/main/java/com/example/fraud/FraudDetectionController.java[tags=new_impl,indent=0]
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server/src/main/java/com/example/fraud/FraudDetectionController.java[tags=initial_impl,indent=0]
}
----

When you execute `./mvnw clean install` again, the tests pass. Since the `Spring Cloud
Contract Verifier` plugin adds the tests to the `generated-test-sources`, you can
actually run those tests from your IDE.

*Deploy your app.*

Once you finish your work, you can deploy your change. First, merge the branch:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff contract-change-pr
$ git push origin master
----

Your CI might run something like `./mvnw clean deploy`, which would publish both the
application and the stub artifacts.

=== Consumer Side (Loan Issuance) Final Step

As a developer of the Loan Issuance service (a consumer of the Fraud Detection server) we will want to:

- merge our feature branch to `master`
- switch to online mode of working


[plantuml, getting-started-cdc-client, png]
----
"Loan\nIssuance"->"Loan\nIssuance": merge the\nfeature branch\nto master branch
"Loan\nIssuance"->"Loan\nIssuance": setup SCC Stub Runner\nto fetch stubs\nfrom Stub Storage
"Loan\nIssuance"->"LI\nSCC\nStub Runner": start stubs\nof FD from\nStub Storage
"LI\nSCC\nStub Runner"->"Stub Storage": find stubs of [FD]
"Stub Storage"->"LI\nSCC\nStub Runner": stubs of [FD] found
"LI\nSCC\nStub Runner"->"FD stub": run stubs of [FD]
"FD stub"->"LI\nSCC\nStub Runner": [FD] stub is running
"LI\nSCC\nStub Runner"->"Loan\nIssuance": stubs running and ready for the test
"Loan\nIssuance"->"Loan\nIssuance": run a test
"Loan\nIssuance"->"FD stub": the test\nsends a request\nto the running stub
"FD stub"->"Loan\nIssuance": stub responds successfuly
"Loan\nIssuance"->"Loan\nIssuance": the test passes successfully
----

*Merge branch to master.*

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff contract-change-pr
----

*Work online.*

Now you can disable the offline work for Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner and indicate
where the repository with your stubs is located. At this moment the stubs of the server
side are automatically downloaded from Nexus/Artifactory. You can set the value of
`stubsMode` to `REMOTE`. The following code shows an example of
achieving the same thing by changing the properties.

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::{introduction_url}/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client/src/test/resources/application-test-repo.yaml[]
----

That's it!
