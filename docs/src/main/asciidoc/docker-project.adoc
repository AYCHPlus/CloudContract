include::_attributes.adoc[]

We're publishing a `springcloud/spring-cloud-contract` Docker image
that contains a project that will generate tests and execute them in `EXPLICIT` mode
against a running application.

TIP: The `EXPLICIT` mode means that the tests generated from contracts will send
real requests and not the mocked ones.

== Short intro to Maven, JARs and Binary storage

Since the Docker image can be used by non JVM projects, it's good to
explain the basic terms behind Spring Cloud Contract packaging defaults.

Part of the following definitions were taken from the https://maven.apache.org/glossary.html[Maven Glossary]

- `Project`: Maven thinks in terms of projects. Everything that you
will build are projects. Those projects follow a well defined
“Project Object Model”. Projects can depend on other projects,
in which case the latter are called “dependencies”. A project may
consistent of several subprojects, however these subprojects are still
treated equally as projects.
- `Artifact`: An artifact is something that is either produced or used
by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project
include: JARs, source and binary distributions. Each artifact
is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is
unique within a group.
- `JAR`: JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a format based on
the ZIP file format. Spring Cloud Contract packages the contracts and generated
stubs in a JAR file.
- `GroupId`: A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project.
While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections),
it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it
from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
Typically, when published to the Artifact Manager, the `GroupId` will get
slash separated and form part of the URL. E.g. for group id `com.example`
and artifact id `application` would be `/com/example/application/`.
- `Classifier`: The Maven dependency notation looks as follows:
`groupId:artifactId:version:classifier`. The classifier is additional suffix
passed to the dependency. E.g. `stubs`, `sources`. The same dependency
e.g. `com.example:application` can produce multiple artifacts that
differ from each other with the classifier.
- `Artifact manager`: When you generate binaries / sources / packages, you would
like them to be available for others to download / reference or reuse. In case
of the JVM world those artifacts would be JARs, for Ruby these are gems
and for Docker those would be Docker images. You can store those artifacts
in a manager. Examples of such managers can be https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory]
or https://www.sonatype.org/nexus/[Nexus].

== How it works

The image searches for contracts under the `/contracts` folder.
The output from running the tests will be available under
`/spring-cloud-contract/build` folder (it's useful for debugging
purposes).

It's enough for you to mount your contracts, pass the environment variables
 and the image will:

- generate the contract tests
- execute the tests against the provided URL
- generate the https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock[WireMock] stubs
- (optional - turned on by default) publish the stubs to a Artifact Manager

=== Environment Variables

The Docker image requires some environment variables to point to
your running application, to the Artifact manager instance etc.

- `PROJECT_GROUP` - your project's group id. Defaults to `com.example`
- `PROJECT_VERSION` - your project's version. Defaults to `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`
- `PROJECT_NAME` - artifact id. Defaults to `example`
- `PRODUCER_STUBS_CLASSIFIER` - archive classifier used for generated producer stubs, defaults to `stubs`.
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` - URL of your Artifact Manager. Defaults to `http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`
which is the default URL of https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory] running locally
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_USERNAME` - (optional) username when the Artifact Manager is secured, defaults to `admin`.
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_PASSWORD` - (optional) password when the Artifact Manager is secured, defaults to `password`.
- `PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS` - if set to `true` then will publish artifact to binary storage. Defaults to `true`.

These environment variables are used when contracts lay in an external repository. To enable
this feature you must set the `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID` environment variable.

- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_GROUP_ID` - group id of the project with contracts. Defaults to `com.example`
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID`- artifact id of the project with contracts.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_CLASSIFIER`- classifier of the project with contracts. Empty by default
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_VERSION` - version of the project with contracts. Defaults to `+`, equivalent to picking the latest
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` - URL of your Artifact Manager. Defaults to value of `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` env var.
If that's not set, defaults to `http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`
which is the default URL of https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory] running locally
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_USERNAME` - (optional) username if the `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL`
requires authentication, defaults to `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_USERNAME`. If that's not set defaults to `admin`.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_PASSWORD` - (optional) password if the `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL`
requires authentication, defaults to `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_PASSWORD`. If that's not set defaults to `password`.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_PATH` - path to contracts for the given project, inside the project with contracts.
Defaults to slash separated `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_GROUP_ID` concatenated with `/` and `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID`. E.g.
for group id `foo.bar` and artifact id `baz`, would result in `foo/bar/baz` contracts path.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_WORK_OFFLINE` - if set to `true` then will retrieve artifact with contracts
from the container's `.m2`. Mount your local `.m2` as a volume available at the container's `/root/.m2` path.
You must not set both `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_WORK_OFFLINE` and `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL`.


These environment variables are used when tests are executed:

- `APPLICATION_BASE_URL` - url against which tests should be executed.
Remember that it has to be accessible from the Docker container (e.g. `localhost`
will not work)
- `APPLICATION_USERNAME` - (optional) username for basic authentication to your application
- `APPLICATION_PASSWORD` - (optional) password for basic authentication to your application

== Example of usage

Let's take a look at a simple MVC application

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs
$ cd bookstore
```

The contracts are available under `/contracts` folder.

[[docker-server-side]]
== Server side (nodejs)

Since we want to run tests, we could just execute:

```bash
$ npm test
```

however, for learning purposes, let's split it into pieces:

```bash
# Stop docker infra (nodejs, artifactory)
$ ./stop_infra.sh
# Start docker infra (nodejs, artifactory)
$ ./setup_infra.sh

# Kill & Run app
$ pkill -f "node app"
$ nohup node app &

# Prepare environment variables
$ SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION="..."
$ APP_IP="192.168.0.100"
$ APP_PORT="3000"
$ ARTIFACTORY_PORT="8081"
$ APPLICATION_BASE_URL="http://${APP_IP}:${APP_PORT}"
$ ARTIFACTORY_URL="http://${APP_IP}:${ARTIFACTORY_PORT}/artifactory/libs-release-local"
$ CURRENT_DIR="$( pwd )"
$ CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME=${PWD##*/}
$ PROJECT_VERSION="0.0.1.RELEASE"

# Execute contract tests
$ docker run  --rm -e "APPLICATION_BASE_URL=${APPLICATION_BASE_URL}" -e "PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS=true" -e "PROJECT_NAME=${CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME}" -e "REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL=${ARTIFACTORY_URL}" -e "PROJECT_VERSION=${PROJECT_VERSION}" -v "${CURRENT_DIR}/contracts/:/contracts:ro" -v "${CURRENT_DIR}/node_modules/spring-cloud-contract/output:/spring-cloud-contract-output/" springcloud/spring-cloud-contract:"${SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION}"

# Kill app
$ pkill -f "node app"
```

What will happen is that via bash scripts:

- infrastructure will be set up (MongoDb, Artifactory).
In real life scenario you would just run the NodeJS application
with mocked database. In this example we want to show how we can
benefit from Spring Cloud Contract in no time.
- due to those constraints the contracts also represent the
stateful situation
** first request is a `POST` that causes data to get inserted to the database
** second request is a `GET` that returns a list of data with 1 previously inserted element
- the NodeJS application will be started (on port `3000`)
- contract tests will be generated via Docker and tests
will be executed against the running application
** the contracts will be taken from `/contracts` folder.
** the output of the test execution is available under
`node_modules/spring-cloud-contract/output`.
- the stubs will be uploaded to Artifactory. You can check them out
under http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/example/bookstore/0.0.1.RELEASE/ .
The stubs will be here http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/example/bookstore/0.0.1.RELEASE/bookstore-0.0.1.RELEASE-stubs.jar.
