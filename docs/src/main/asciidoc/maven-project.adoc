To learn how to set up the Maven project for Spring Cloud Contract Verifier, read the
following sections:

* <<maven-add-plugin>>
* <<maven-rest-assured>>
* <<maven-snapshot-versions>>
* <<maven-add-stubs>>
* <<maven-run-plugin>>

[[maven-add-plugin]]
== Add maven plugin

Add the Spring Cloud Contract BOM in a fashion similar to this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_bom,indent=0]
----

Next, add the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` Maven plugin:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_maven_plugin,indent=0]
----

You can read more in the
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.0.0.RELEASE/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/[Spring
Cloud Contract Maven Plugin Documentation (example for `2.0.0.RELEASE` version)].

[[maven-rest-assured]]
== Maven and Rest Assured 2.0

By default, Rest Assured 3.x is added to the classpath. However, you can use Rest
Assured 2.x by adding it to the plugins classpath, as shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <packageWithBaseClasses>com.example</packageWithBaseClasses>
    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-verifier</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
           <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
           <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
           <version>2.5.0</version>
           <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
           <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-mock-mvc</artifactId>
           <version>2.5.0</version>
           <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>

<dependencies>
    <!-- all dependencies -->
    <!-- you can exclude rest-assured from spring-cloud-contract-verifier -->
    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
       <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
       <version>2.5.0</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-mock-mvc</artifactId>
       <version>2.5.0</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

That way, the plugin automatically sees that Rest Assured 3.x is present on the classpath
and modifies the imports accordingly.

[[maven-snapshot-versions]]
== Snapshot versions for Maven

For Snapshot and Milestone versions, you have to add the following section to your
`pom.xml`, as shown here:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=repos,indent=0]
----

[[maven-add-stubs]]
== Add stubs

By default, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is looking for stubs in the
`src/test/resources/contracts` directory. The directory containing stub definitions is
treated as a class name, and each stub definition is treated as a single test. We assume
that it contains at least one directory to be used as test class name. If there is more
than one level of nested directories, all except the last one is used as package name.
For example, with following structure:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldReturnUser.groovy
----

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier creates a test class named `defaultBasePackage.MyService`
with two methods

* `shouldCreateUser()`
* `shouldReturnUser()`

[[maven-run-plugin]]
== Run plugin

The plugin goal `generateTests` is assigned to be invoked in the phase called
`generate-test-sources`. If you want it to be part of your build process, you need not do
anything. If you just want to generate tests, invoke the `generateTests` goal.

[[maven-configure-plugin]]
== Configure plugin

To change the default configuration, just add a `configuration` section to the plugin
definition or the `execution` definition, as shown here:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>convert</goal>
                <goal>generateStubs</goal>
                <goal>generateTests</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <basePackageForTests>org.springframework.cloud.verifier.twitter.place</basePackageForTests>
        <baseClassForTests>org.springframework.cloud.verifier.twitter.place.BaseMockMvcSpec</baseClassForTests>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

[[maven-configuration-options]]
== Configuration Options

* *testMode*: Defines the mode for acceptance tests. By default, the mode is MockMvc,
which is based on Spring's MockMvc. It can also be changed to *WebTestClient*, *JaxRsClient* or to
*Explicit* for real HTTP calls.
* *basePackageForTests*: Specifies the base package for all generated tests. If not set,
the value is picked from `baseClassForTests`'s package and from `packageWithBaseClasses`.
If neither of these values are set, then the value is set to
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests`.
* *ruleClassForTests*: Specifies a rule that should be added to the generated test
classes.
* *baseClassForTests*: Creates a base class for all generated tests. By default, if you
use Spock classes, the class is `spock.lang.Specification`.
* *contractsDirectory*: Specifies a directory containing contracts written with the
GroovyDSL. The default directory is `/src/test/resources/contracts`.
* *generatedTestSourcesDir*: Specifies the test source directory where tests generated
from the Groovy DSL should be placed. By default its value is
`$buildDir/generated-test-sources/contracts`.
* *generatedTestResourcesDir*: Specifies the test resource directory where resources used by the tests generated
* *testFramework*: Specifies the target test framework to be used. Currently, Spock, JUnit 4 (`TestFramework.JUNIT`) and 
JUnit 5 are supported with JUnit 4 being the default framework.
* *packageWithBaseClasses*: Defines a package where all the base classes reside. This
setting takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*. The convention is such that, if you
have a contract under (for example) `src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and set
the value of the `packageWithBaseClasses` property to `com.example.base`, then Spring
Cloud Contract Verifier assumes that there is a `BarBazBase` class under the
`com.example.base` package. In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the
package, if they exist, and forms a class with a `Base` suffix.
* *baseClassMappings*: Specifies a list of base class mappings that provide
`contractPackageRegex`, which is checked against the package where the contract is
located, and `baseClassFQN`, which maps to the fully qualified name of the base class for
the matched contract. For example, if you have a contract under
`src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and map the property
`.* -> com.example.base.BaseClass`, then the test class generated from these contracts
extends `com.example.base.BaseClass`. This setting takes precedence over
*packageWithBaseClasses* and *baseClassForTests*.
* *contractsProperties*: a map containing properties to be passed to Spring Cloud Contract
components. Those properties might be used by e.g. inbuilt or custom Stub Downloaders.

If you want to download your contract definitions from a Maven repository, you can use
the following options:

* *contractDependency*: The contract dependency that contains all the packaged contracts.
* *contractsPath*: The path to the concrete contracts in the JAR with packaged contracts.
Defaults to `groupid/artifactid` where `gropuid` is slash separated.
* *contractsMode*: Picks the mode in which stubs will be found and registered
* *deleteStubsAfterTest*: If set to `false` will not remove any downloaded
contracts from temporary directories
* *contractsRepositoryUrl*: URL to a repo with the artifacts that have contracts. If it is not provided,
use the current Maven ones.
* *contractsRepositoryUsername*: The user name to be used to connect to the repo with contracts.
* *contractsRepositoryPassword*: The password to be used to connect to the repo with contracts.
* *contractsRepositoryProxyHost*: The proxy host to be used to connect to the repo with contracts.
* *contractsRepositoryProxyPort*: The proxy port to be used to connect to the repo with contracts.

We cache only non-snapshot, explicitly provided versions (for example
`+` or `1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` won't get cached). By default, this feature is turned on.

Below you can find a list of experimental features you can turn on via the plugin:

* *convertToYaml*: converts all DSLs to the declarative, YAML format. This can be extremely useful when you're using external libraries in your Groovy DSLs. By turning this feature on (by setting it to `true`) you will not need to add the library dependency on the consumer side.
* *assertJsonSize*: You can check the size of JSON arrays in the generated tests. This feature is disabled by default.

[[maven-single-base]]
== Single Base Class for All Tests

When using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier in default MockMvc, you need to create a base
specification for all generated acceptance tests. In this class, you need to point to an
endpoint, which should be verified.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
package org.mycompany.tests

import org.mycompany.ExampleSpringController
import com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc
import spock.lang.Specification

class MvcSpec extends Specification {
  def setup() {
   RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new ExampleSpringController())
  }
}
----

You can also setup the whole context if necessary.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import io.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT, classes = SomeConfig.class, properties="some=property")
public abstract class BaseTestClass {

	@Autowired
	WebApplicationContext context;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		RestAssuredMockMvc.webAppContextSetup(this.context);
	}
}
----

If you use `EXPLICIT` mode, you can use a base class to initialize the whole tested app
similarly, as you might find in regular integration tests.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import io.restassured.RestAssured;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.web.server.LocalServerPort
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT, classes = SomeConfig.class, properties="some=property")
public abstract class BaseTestClass {

	@LocalServerPort
	int port;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		RestAssured.baseURI = "http://localhost:" + this.port;
	}
}
----

If you use the `JAXRSCLIENT` mode, this base class should also contain a `protected WebTarget webTarget` field. Right
now, the only option to test the JAX-RS API is to start a web server.

[[maven-different-base]]
== Different base classes for contracts

If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:

* Follow a convention by providing the `packageWithBaseClasses`
* provide explicit mapping via `baseClassMappings`

*By Convention*

The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
`src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and set the value of the
`packageWithBaseClasses` property to `com.example.base`, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a `BarBazBase` class under the `com.example.base` package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a `Base` suffix. This rule takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*.
Here is an example of how it works in the `contracts` closure:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/src/test/projects/basic-generated-baseclass/pom.xml[tags=convention,indent=0]
----

*By Mapping*

You can manually map a regular expression of the contract's package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
`baseClassMappings` that consists `baseClassMapping` objects that takes a
`contractPackageRegex` to `baseClassFQN` mapping. Consider the following example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/src/test/projects/basic-baseclass-from-mappings/pom.xml[tags=mapping,indent=0]
----

Assume that you have contracts under these two locations:
* `src/test/resources/contract/com/`
* `src/test/resources/contract/foo/`

By providing the `baseClassForTests`, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You can also provide the `packageWithBaseClasses` as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from `src/test/resources/contract/com/` contracts extend the
`com.example.ComBase`, whereas the rest of the tests extend `com.example.FooBase`.

[[maven-invoking-generated-tests]]
== Invoking generated tests

The Spring Cloud Contract Maven Plugin generates verification code in a directory called
`/generated-test-sources/contractVerifier` and attaches this directory to `testCompile`
goal.

For Groovy Spock code, use the following:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.codehaus.gmavenplus</groupId>
	<artifactId>gmavenplus-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>1.5</version>
	<executions>
		<execution>
			<goals>
				<goal>testCompile</goal>
			</goals>
		</execution>
	</executions>
	<configuration>
		<testSources>
			<testSource>
				<directory>${project.basedir}/src/test/groovy</directory>
				<includes>
					<include>**/*.groovy</include>
				</includes>
			</testSource>
			<testSource>
				<directory>${project.build.directory}/generated-test-sources/contractVerifier</directory>
				<includes>
					<include>**/*.groovy</include>
				</includes>
			</testSource>
		</testSources>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
----

To ensure that provider side is compliant with defined contracts, you need to invoke
`mvn generateTest test`.

[[maven-pushing-stubs-to-scm]]
== Pushing stubs to SCM

If you're using the SCM repository to keep the contracts and
stubs, you might want to automate the step of pushing stubs to
the repository. To do that, it's enough to add the `pushStubsToScm`
goal. Example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <!-- Base class mappings etc. -->

        <!-- We want to pick contracts from a Git repository -->
        <contractsRepositoryUrl>git://https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs-contracts-git.git</contractsRepositoryUrl>

        <!-- We reuse the contract dependency section to set up the path
        to the folder that contains the contract definitions. In our case the
        path will be /groupId/artifactId/version/contracts -->
        <contractDependency>
            <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
            <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </contractDependency>

        <!-- The contracts mode can't be classpath -->
        <contractsMode>REMOTE</contractsMode>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <!-- By default we will not push the stubs back to SCM,
                you have to explicitly add it as a goal -->
                <goal>pushStubsToScm</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

Under <<scm-stub-downloader>> you can find all possible
configuration options that you can pass either via
the `<configuration><contractProperties>` map, a system property
or an environment variable.

[[maven-sts]]
== Maven Plugin and STS

If you see the following exception while using STS:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/sts_exception.png[STS Exception]

When you click on the error marker you should see something like this:

== Maven Plugin with Spock Tests

You can select the http://spockframework.org/[Spock Framework] for creating and executing the auto-generated contract
verification tests with both Maven and Gradle plugin. However, whereas with Gradle its really straightforward,
in Maven you will require some additional setup in order to make the tests compile and execute properly.

First of all, you will have to use a plugin, such as https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus[GMavenPlus] plugin,
to add Groovy to your project. In GMavenPlus plugin, you will need to explicitly set test sources, including both the
path where your base test classes are defined and the path were the generated contract tests are added.
Please refer to the example below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples_url}/producer_with_spock/pom.xml[tags=gmavenplus-setup,indent=0]
----

If you uphold to the Spock convention of ending the test class names with `Spec`, you will also need to adjust your Maven
Surefire plugin setup, like in the following example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples_url}/producer_with_spock/pom.xml[tags=spock-surefire-setup,indent=0]
----

= Stubs and Transitive Dependencies

The Maven and Gradle plugin that add the tasks that create the stubs jar for you. One
problem that arises is that, when reusing the stubs, you can mistakenly import all of
that stub's dependencies. When building a Maven artifact, even though you have a couple
of different jars, all of them share one pom:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar.sha1
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075655-2-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075655-2-stubs.jar.sha1
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.pom
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
├── ...
└── ...
----

There are three possibilities of working with those dependencies so as not to have any
issues with transitive dependencies:

* Mark all application dependencies as optional
* Create a separate artifactid for the stubs
* Exclude dependencies on the consumer side

*Mark all application dependencies as optional*

If, in the `github-webhook` application, you mark all of your dependencies as optional,
when you include the `github-webhook` stubs in another application (or when that
dependency gets downloaded by Stub Runner) then, since all of the dependencies are
optional, they will not get downloaded.

*Create a separate `artifactid` for the stubs*

If you create a separate `artifactid`, then you can set it up in whatever way you wish.
For example, you might decide to have no dependencies at all.

*Exclude dependencies on the consumer side*

As a consumer, if you add the stub dependency to your classpath, you can explicitly
exclude the unwanted dependencies.

= Scenarios

You can handle scenarios with Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. All you need to do is to
stick to the proper naming convention while creating your contracts. The convention
requires including an order number followed by an underscore. This will work regardles
 of whether you're working with YAML or Groovy. Example:

[source,indent=0]
----
my_contracts_dir\
  scenario1\
    1_login.groovy
    2_showCart.groovy
    3_logout.groovy
----

Such a tree causes Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to generate WireMock's scenario with a
name of `scenario1` and the three following steps:

. login marked as `Started` pointing to...
. showCart marked as `Step1` pointing to...
. logout marked as `Step2` which will close the scenario.

More details about WireMock scenarios can be found at
https://wiremock.org/docs/stateful-behaviour/[https://wiremock.org/docs/stateful-behaviour/]

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier also generates tests with a guaranteed order of execution.

[[docker-project]]
= Docker Project

We're publishing a `springcloud/spring-cloud-contract` Docker image
that contains a project that will generate tests and execute them in `EXPLICIT` mode
against a running application.

TIP: The `EXPLICIT` mode means that the tests generated from contracts will send
real requests and not the mocked ones.

== Short intro to Maven, JARs and Binary storage

Since the Docker image can be used by non JVM projects, it's good to
explain the basic terms behind Spring Cloud Contract packaging defaults.

Part of the following definitions were taken from the https://maven.apache.org/glossary.html[Maven Glossary]

- `Project`: Maven thinks in terms of projects. Everything that you
will build are projects. Those projects follow a well defined
“Project Object Model”. Projects can depend on other projects,
in which case the latter are called “dependencies”. A project may
consistent of several subprojects, however these subprojects are still
treated equally as projects.
- `Artifact`: An artifact is something that is either produced or used
by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project
include: JARs, source and binary distributions. Each artifact
is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is
unique within a group.
- `JAR`: JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a format based on
the ZIP file format. Spring Cloud Contract packages the contracts and generated
stubs in a JAR file.
- `GroupId`: A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project.
While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections),
it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it
from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
Typically, when published to the Artifact Manager, the `GroupId` will get
slash separated and form part of the URL. E.g. for group id `com.example`
and artifact id `application` would be `/com/example/application/`.
- `Classifier`: The Maven dependency notation looks as follows:
`groupId:artifactId:version:classifier`. The classifier is additional suffix
passed to the dependency. E.g. `stubs`, `sources`. The same dependency
e.g. `com.example:application` can produce multiple artifacts that
differ from each other with the classifier.
- `Artifact manager`: When you generate binaries / sources / packages, you would
like them to be available for others to download / reference or reuse. In case
of the JVM world those artifacts would be JARs, for Ruby these are gems
and for Docker those would be Docker images. You can store those artifacts
in a manager. Examples of such managers can be https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory]
or https://www.sonatype.org/nexus/[Nexus].

== How it works

The image searches for contracts under the `/contracts` folder.
The output from running the tests will be available under
`/spring-cloud-contract/build` folder (it's useful for debugging
purposes).

It's enough for you to mount your contracts, pass the environment variables
 and the image will:

- generate the contract tests
- execute the tests against the provided URL
- generate the https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock[WireMock] stubs
- (optional - turned on by default) publish the stubs to a Artifact Manager

=== Environment Variables

The Docker image requires some environment variables to point to
your running application, to the Artifact manager instance etc.

- `PROJECT_GROUP` - your project's group id. Defaults to `com.example`
- `PROJECT_VERSION` - your project's version. Defaults to `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`
- `PROJECT_NAME` - artifact id. Defaults to `example`
- `PRODUCER_STUBS_CLASSIFIER` - archive classifier used for generated producer stubs, defaults to `stubs`.
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` - URL of your Artifact Manager. Defaults to `http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`
which is the default URL of https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory] running locally
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_USERNAME` - (optional) username when the Artifact Manager is secured, defaults to `admin`.
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_PASSWORD` - (optional) password when the Artifact Manager is secured, defaults to `password`.
- `PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS` - if set to `true` then will publish artifact to binary storage. Defaults to `true`.

These environment variables are used when contracts lay in an external repository. To enable
this feature you must set the `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID` environment variable.

- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_GROUP_ID` - group id of the project with contracts. Defaults to `com.example`
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID`- artifact id of the project with contracts.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_CLASSIFIER`- classifier of the project with contracts. Empty by default
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_VERSION` - version of the project with contracts. Defaults to `+`, equivalent to picking the latest
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` - URL of your Artifact Manager. Defaults to value of `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` env var.
If that's not set, defaults to `http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`
which is the default URL of https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory] running locally
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_USERNAME` - (optional) username if the `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL`
requires authentication, defaults to `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_USERNAME`. If that's not set defaults to `admin`.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_PASSWORD` - (optional) password if the `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL`
requires authentication, defaults to `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_PASSWORD`. If that's not set defaults to `password`.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_PATH` - path to contracts for the given project, inside the project with contracts.
Defaults to slash separated `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_GROUP_ID` concatenated with `/` and `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID`. E.g.
for group id `foo.bar` and artifact id `baz`, would result in `foo/bar/baz` contracts path.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_WORK_OFFLINE` - if set to `true` then will retrieve artifact with contracts
from the container's `.m2`. Mount your local `.m2` as a volume available at the container's `/root/.m2` path.
You must not set both `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_WORK_OFFLINE` and `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL`.


These environment variables are used when tests are executed:

- `APPLICATION_BASE_URL` - url against which tests should be executed.
Remember that it has to be accessible from the Docker container (e.g. `localhost`
will not work)
- `APPLICATION_USERNAME` - (optional) username for basic authentication to your application
- `APPLICATION_PASSWORD` - (optional) password for basic authentication to your application

== Example of usage

Let's take a look at a simple MVC application

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs
$ cd bookstore
```

The contracts are available under `/contracts` folder.

[[docker-server-side]]
== Server side (nodejs)

Since we want to run tests, we could just execute:

```bash
$ npm test
```

however, for learning purposes, let's split it into pieces:

```bash
# Stop docker infra (nodejs, artifactory)
$ ./stop_infra.sh
# Start docker infra (nodejs, artifactory)
$ ./setup_infra.sh

# Kill & Run app
$ pkill -f "node app"
$ nohup node app &

# Prepare environment variables
$ SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION="..."
$ APP_IP="192.168.0.100"
$ APP_PORT="3000"
$ ARTIFACTORY_PORT="8081"
$ APPLICATION_BASE_URL="http://${APP_IP}:${APP_PORT}"
$ ARTIFACTORY_URL="http://${APP_IP}:${ARTIFACTORY_PORT}/artifactory/libs-release-local"
$ CURRENT_DIR="$( pwd )"
$ CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME=${PWD##*/}
$ PROJECT_VERSION="0.0.1.RELEASE"

# Execute contract tests
$ docker run  --rm -e "APPLICATION_BASE_URL=${APPLICATION_BASE_URL}" -e "PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS=true" -e "PROJECT_NAME=${CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME}" -e "REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL=${ARTIFACTORY_URL}" -e "PROJECT_VERSION=${PROJECT_VERSION}" -v "${CURRENT_DIR}/contracts/:/contracts:ro" -v "${CURRENT_DIR}/node_modules/spring-cloud-contract/output:/spring-cloud-contract-output/" springcloud/spring-cloud-contract:"${SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION}"

# Kill app
$ pkill -f "node app"
```

What will happen is that via bash scripts:

- infrastructure will be set up (MongoDb, Artifactory).
In real life scenario you would just run the NodeJS application
with mocked database. In this example we want to show how we can
benefit from Spring Cloud Contract in no time.
- due to those constraints the contracts also represent the
stateful situation
** first request is a `POST` that causes data to get inserted to the database
** second request is a `GET` that returns a list of data with 1 previously inserted element
- the NodeJS application will be started (on port `3000`)
- contract tests will be generated via Docker and tests
will be executed against the running application
** the contracts will be taken from `/contracts` folder.
** the output of the test execution is available under
`node_modules/spring-cloud-contract/output`.
- the stubs will be uploaded to Artifactory. You can check them out
under http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/example/bookstore/0.0.1.RELEASE/ .
The stubs will be here http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/example/bookstore/0.0.1.RELEASE/bookstore-0.0.1.RELEASE-stubs.jar.
